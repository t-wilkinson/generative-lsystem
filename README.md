### Intro
Around the same time I first started learning python, I developed a great love for fractals and recursion from *extracurricular activities*. I used python to somewhat satisfy this love during my breaks from my aforementioned *activities*. 

### What this is
This was one of my first python projects so the code is a bit of a mess, not well documented, and likely full of bad practices. I created multiple versions of this project, this repository holds my last two versions however as I learned python, I tried to apply what I was learning to my projects and eventually arrived at these two (doing so is a great way to learn programming). 
**lsystem.py** is the second to last version. It truly is a *mess* of code. **main.py** is my last version. Code is much cleaner and organized however it does not exactly work as I would expect, however some refactoring should get it to work.

### What is an LSystem?
These projects are based on an lsystem, a way of creating fractals. [Here](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/) is a GREAT source for learning more about what these lsystems are as I cannot do them justice.


### How to run
To run the file that works simply run in your terminal:
  
`python lsystem.py`
  
Feel free to mess with the code at the bottom, I tried to make the options intuitive but I likely failed.
Note that you can whatever you want with the code.
