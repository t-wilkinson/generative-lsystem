# L-System (Lindenmayer Systems) Visualization

## What is this
My first python project (and one of my first ever) was a program that visualized simple fractals using a turtle (basic commands like forward, turn, pen up and pen down). As I learned more, I needed a way to express what I had learned and a new way to visualize fractals. Here comes l-systems.

## What is an L-System?
An l-system is essentially a type of computation, that is, a series of re-writing rules from some inital condition. A program then interprets the final output of the computation as instructions of what to draw. [Here](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/) is a great resource for learning more.

## Running
> python lsystem.py
