# About
This project is a visualization of [Lindenmayer Systems (l-systems)](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/). There are two versions. The first was my first computer program which accumulated over about a month as I learned how to program. The second version was my attempt simplify the program.

Program was tested using python 3.5. The project uses `pyglet` for OpenGL integration and `numpy` for array operations.

# Running
```bash
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
`main.py` runs both the old and new versions. Look to it for an example of how to use each.
