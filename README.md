# About
This project is a visualization of [Lindenmayer Systems (l-systems)](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/). There are two versions. The first was my first computer program which was accumulated over about a month as I learned how to program. The second version was my attempt to come back and simplify the process after I had become more competent. Program was tested using python 3.5. The project uses pyglet for visualizations and numpy for array operations.

# Running
```bash
python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt
python lsystem-v1.py
python lsystem-v2.py
